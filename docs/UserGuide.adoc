== Introduction

Modulo is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their school work on a modular level*.
It helps you to break down your modules into deadlines and track their progress.
More importantly, Modulo is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Modulo can get your module management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Enjoy!

== Quick Start

. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
. Download the latest `modulo.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Modulo.
. Double-click the file to start the app.
The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
. Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
. Some example commands you can try:

* **`module`**`m/CS2103` : add new module
* **`list e`**: view events occuring from today onwards
* *`exit`* : exits the app

. Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `module m/MODULE CODE`, `MODULE CODE`
is a parameter which can be used as `module m/CS2103`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `list [all] e` can be used as `list all e` or as `list e`.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `m/MODULE CODE n/NAME`, `n/NAME m/MODULE CODE` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Opens the pop-up help window with the link to this user guide. +
Format: `help`

=== Adding a module: `module`

Adds a module to Modulo.
The default timeframe is set to the current academic year and semester. +
Format: `module m/MODULE CODE [ay/ACADEMIC YEAR] [s/SEMESTER NUMBER]`

Examples:

* `module m/cs2103 ay/2019/2020 s/2`
* `module m/cs2100`

This command will kickstart the autopopulation of module events.
You will be prompted to enter the slot numbers for all events under this module, e.g. tutorial slot 2, lecture slot 1, lab slot 13, etc.

Example of prompts by Modulo:

* `Enter slot for CS2100 Lab:`
* `Enter slot for LAJ1201 Tutorial Type 2:`

*****
* There are limitations with module data obtained from NUS. For example, based on official records, some tutorials will start from Week 1, despite actually only starting in Week 3.
* If you quit Modulo in the middle of this process, your autopopulation will be incomplete!
You may have to restart the process by deleting the module and re-adding it.
Do see the section on <<Delete,deleting a module>> below.
*****

=== Adding an event : `event`

Adds an event to a module.
This is perhaps the lengthiest command in Modulo.
Events refer to Tutorials, Lectures, Examinations, etc. +

There are two possible scenarios: +

*You're currently <<View,viewing>> a module on the right UI panel.*

You can add an event straight to the module you're currently viewing.

Format: `event n/EVENT NAME s/START DATETIME e/END DATETIME v/VENUE [r/REPEAT] [f/FREQUENCY]
[until/REPEAT_STOP_DATE]`

Example (while viewing CS2103):

* `event n/Tutorial s/2020-01-30 11:00 e/2020-01-30 10:00 v/COM1-B103 r/YES until/2020-05-08`

*****
* Modulo recognises datetime formats of YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM.
* The default repeat frequency (in weeks) is 1.
* By default, the event will not repeat.
The default repeat end date, if not specified, is Week 13 of the semester.
*****

*You're not <<View,viewing>> a module or you're adding the event to a module not being viewed.*

You can add an event to a specified module that you have already created before.

Format: `event m/MODULE CODE n/EVENT NAME s/START DATETIME e/END DATETIME v/VENUE [r/REPEAT] [f/FREQUENCY]
[until/REPEAT_STOP_DATE]`

Example:

* `event m/CS2103 n/Tutorial s/2020-01-30 11:00 e/2020-01-30 10:00 v/COM1-B103 r/YES until/2020-05-08`

*****
* All events with types that are recognised come with a default `deadline` created.
Examples of recognised types would be:
`Tutorial`, `Lecture`, etc.
*****

[[AddingDeadline]]
=== Adding a deadline : `deadline`

Adds a deadline to an event.
There are two possible scenarios: +

*You're currently <<View,viewing>> an event on the right UI panel.*

You can add a deadline straight to the event you're currently viewing.

Format: `deadline n/DEADLINE NAME [r/REPEAT]`

Example (while viewing CS2103 Tutorial 3):

* `deadline n/Practice UML Diagrams r/YES`

*****
* Repeated deadlines are added to events of the same type as the one specified, and have yet to occur.
* By default, the deadline will not repeat.
* This may result in what seems like a "bug" when you try to add repeated deadlines, starting with an event that has already passed, since the deadline will be added to that event itself.
*****

*You're not <<View,viewing>> an event or you're adding the deadline to an event not being viewed.*

You can add a deadline to a specified event that you have already created before.

Format: `deadline m/MODULE CODE e/EVENT NAME n/DEADLINE NAME [r/REPEAT]`

Example:

* `deadline m/CS2103 e/Tutorial 3 n/Practice UML Diagrams r/YES`

****
* Automatically adds a deadline to the nearest event of this name
* If the deadline is to be added to all events of this type, e.g. Tutorials, then set r (repeat) to YES
****

Examples:

* `deadline m/CS2103 e/Tutorial n/Homework r/NO` +
Adds a Homework deadline to the nearest upcoming tutorial of CS2103

[[ListAll]]
=== Displaying all events and modules: `list all`

Shows a list of all events or modules in the left panel of Modulo. +
Format: `list all event / list all module`

Examples:

* `list all event / list all e` +
Shows all the events in the left display panel

* `list all module / list all m` +
Shows all the modules in the left display panel

****
* Shows all events or modules recorded in Modulo, depending on the current list.
* For events, this would include events that have already passed.
* Do note that adding deadlines to these past events may result in unexpected behaviour.
Do see the above section on <<AddingDeadline,adding a deadline>> for more information.
****

[[List]]
=== Displaying all events based on current timeframe: `list`

Shows the list of future events or modules happening from the current date onwards. +
Format: `list event / list module`

Examples:

* `list event / list e` +
Shows all the events happening from the current date onwards on the left display panel.
* `list module / list m` +
Shows all the modules happening from the current date onwards on the left display panel.

****
* This is the default filter!
****

=== Find an event / module [keywords]: `find`

Allows the user to find a module or event which matches any of the given keywords.

* The search is case insensitive. e.g `find tutorial` will produce all events that match Tutorial.
* Names containing part of the searched words will be matched e.g. `find tut` will match Tutorial 4.
* Modules can be searched according to their Module code, Name as well as Academic Year.
* Events can be searched according to their Module code and Name.

Format: `find SEARCH TERM` while the left panel of Modulo is <<List,listing>> modules:

****
* Shows the modules with Name / Module Code / Academic Year that match the search term.
****

Format: `find SEARCH TERM` while the left panel of Modulo is <<List,listing>> events:

****
* Shows the events with Name / Module Code that match the search term
****

Points to note:

* The `find` command allows the user to continually filter their list of searches. E.g.
While viewing the list of events, entering `find cs2103` and then `find tutorial` right after will allow the user to view CS2103 tutorials.
* After finding a module / event, to undo and <<List,list>> the whole list of modules or events again, users are recommended to enter `list event`
or `list module`.

=== Finishing a task : `done`

Command to set a deadline's status to be `Completed` +

Scenario 1: If the user is currently not viewing an event or is not viewing the event of interest, the following format will be used:

* Format: `done index m/MODULE_CODE n/EVENT_NAME` +

****
* Every event can only have one deadline.
Therefore,the index is one-based and always is 1.
* Searched the deadline from the module's event, if deadline exists it will update the status to be completed.
* Otherwise, it will display deadline does not exists message.
****

* Example: `done 1 m/CS2103 n/Tutorial 1` +
Set the deadline of the CS2103's Tutorial 1 to be completed.

Scenario 2: If the user already be viewing the event of interest.
The following command can then be used :

* Format: `done index` +
The index is one-based also.

* Example: `done 1` +
Set the deadline on the right panel list to be completed.

=== Export calendar: `export`

Allows user to export all events and deadlines as a .ics file. File will be named modulo.ics inside the export directory.

If no directory is defined, Modulo will deposit the .ics file in the data folder.

* .ics file will be generated with Singapore (Asia) timezone.
* Event entity will be converted as VEVENT.
* Deadline entity will be exported as VTODO.
* However, as certain common calendar applications (e.g. Google Calendars, Microsoft Outlook) do not parse VTODO, summarized deadlines are also displayed under event description.

Format: `export [d/TARGET_DIRECTORY]`

[[Delete]]
=== Deleting a module/event/deadline: `delete`

Allows the user to delete a module, event, or deadline.
Deleting a module will delete all its associated events.
Deleting an event with delete all its associated deadlines.

* Deletion will depend on whether modules or events are displayed in the left panel of Modulo
* Users can choose to delete modules or events by index: `delete 1`
* Users can choose to delete modules or events based on description E.g. `delete tut`
* For deadlines, users are required to click on the event containing the deadline - `delete d/1` will then delete the deadline of index 1 of the event.

Examples: +

* `delete 1` +
Deletes the module / event of index 1

* `delete DESCRIPTION` +
1. If the left panel of Modulo displays Modules, deletes all Modules which Name / Module code / Academic Year contains `DESCRIPTION`
2. If the left panel of Modulo displays Events, deletes all Events which Name / Module code contains `DESCRIPTION`
{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

* `delete all` +
Deletes all modules / events depending on what is being <<View,viewed>> on the left panel of Modulo.

* `delete d/1` +
Deletes the deadline of index 1 from the event <<View,viewed>> on the right panel of Modulo.

* `delete d/all` +
Deletes all the deadlines from the event <<View,viewed>> on the right panel of Modulo.

[[View]]
=== Viewing module or event details : `view`

Lets user view the details for a module or event on the right panel based on its index on the left panel.
This index is based on the current list being listed. +

Format: `view INDEX`

Example:

* `view 1`
