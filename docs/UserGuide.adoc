== Introduction

Modulo is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their school work on a modular level*. It helps you to break down your modules into deadlines and track their progress. More importantly, Modulo is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Modulo can get your module management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to Section 2, <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `modulo.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Modulo.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* **`module`**`n/CS2103 y/2020 s/2` : add new module
* **`today`**: view deadlines due today
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
