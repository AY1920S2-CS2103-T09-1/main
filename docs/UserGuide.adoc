== Introduction

Modulo is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their school work on a modular level*.
It helps you to break down your modules into deadlines and track their progress.
More importantly, Modulo is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Modulo can get your module management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Enjoy!

== Quick Start

. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
. Download the latest `modulo.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Modulo.
. Double-click the file to start the app.
The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
. Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
. Some example commands you can try:

* **`module`**`n/CS2103 y/2020 s/2` : add new module
* **`today`**: view deadlines due today
* *`exit`* : exits the app

. Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `module n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `module n/CS2103`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `list [m/MONTH]` can be used as `list m/July` or as `list`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[m/MONTH]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `m/JULY`, `m/JULY m/MARCH` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `m/MODULE n/NAME`, `n/NAME m/MODULE` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding a module: `module`

Adds a module to Modulo.
The default timeframe is set to the current academic year, AY19/20. +
Format: `module n/NAME`

Example:

* `module n/cs2103`

=== Adding an event : `event`

Adds an event to a module Format: event m/MODULE n/NAME t/TIME f/FREQUENCY

Autopopulated based on keyword detection, e.g. Tutorials added for weekly will be populated from Week 3-13, and will have numbers automatically appended, e.g. Tutorial 1, Tutorial 2. A default deadline will also be added to the event, e.g. Tutorial Homework

=== Adding a deadline : `deadline`

Adds a deadline to an event.
Format: `deadline m/MODULE e/EVENT NAME n/DESCRIPTION [r/YES/NO]`

****
* Automatically adds a deadline to the nearest event of this name
* If the deadline is to be added to all events of this type, e.g. Tutorials, then set r (repeat) to YES
****

Examples:

* `deadline m/CS2103 e/Tutorial n/Homework r/NO` +
Adds a Homework deadline to the nearest upcoming tutorial of CS2103

=== Displaying all events and modules: `list all`

Shows a list of all events or modules in the left panel of Modulo. +
Format: `list all event / list all module`

Examples:

* `list all event / list all e` +
Shows all the events in the left display panel

* `list all module / list all m` +
Shows all the modules in the left display panel

****
* Shows all events or modules recorded in Modulo.
****


=== Displaying all events based on current timeframe: `list`

Shows the list of future events or modules happening from the current date onwards. +
Format: `list event / list module`

Examples:

* `list event / list e` +
Shows all the events happening from the current date onwards on the left display panel.
* `list module / list m` +
Shows all the modules happening from the current date onwards on the left display panel.

****
* Shows the events happening from the current date onwards.
****

=== Find an event / module [keywords]: `find`

Allows the user to find a module or event which matches any of the given keywords.

* The search is case insensitive. e.g `find tutorial` will produce all events that match Tutorial
* Names containing part of the searched words will be matched e.g. `find tut` will match Tutorial 4
* Modules can be searched according to their Module code, Name as well as Academic Year
* Events can be searched according to their Module code and Name



Format: `find DESCRIPTION` while the left panel of Modulo is viewing modules:


****
* Shows the modules that Name / Module Code / Academic Year matches the description
****

Format: `find DESCRIPTION` while the left panel of Modulo is viewing events:
****
* Shows the events that Name / Module code matches the description
****

Points to note:

* The `find` command allows the user to continually filter their list of searches. E.g. While viewing the
list of events, entering `find cs2103` and then `find tutorial` right after will allow the user to view
cs2103 tutorials.
* After finding a module / event, to undo and view the whole list of modules or events again, users are recommended to enter `list event`
or `list module`.


=== Finishing a task : `done`

If the user is currently not viewing an event or is not viewing the event of interest, the following format will be used:
and bring the closest event to focus e.g. Tutorial 4 happening on Week 6, where the UI will prompt the user: “Which deadline do you wish to complete?”

Format: `done m/MODULE_CODE n/EVENT_NAME`

The following command can then be used (or be used instantly should the user already be viewing the event of interest):
and complete the first deadline on the list of deadlines for that event.

Format: `done 1`

=== Export: `export`

User could export all the module, event, and deadlines as a .ics file.

Format: `export [s/START_DATE] [e/END_DATE] [d/TARGET_DIRECTORY] f/FILENAME`

=== Deleting a module/event/deadline: `delete`

Allows the user to delete a module, event, or deadline. Deleting a module will delete all its associated events. Deleting an event with delete all its
associated deadlines.

* Deletion will depend on whether modules or events are displayed in the left panel of Modulo
* Users can choose to delete modules or events by index: `delete 1`
* Users can choose to delete modules or events based on description E.g. `delete tut`
* For deadlines, users are required to click on the event containing the deadline - `delete d/1` will then delete the
deadline of index 1 of the event.


Examples: +

* `delete 1` +
Deletes the module / event of index 1

* `delete DESCRIPTION` +
1. If the left panel of Modulo displays Modules, deletes all Modules which Name / Module code / Academic Year
contains `DESCRIPTION`
2. If the left panel of Modulo displays Events, deletes all Events which Name / Module code
contains `DESCRIPTION`
{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

* `delete all` +
Deletes all modules / events depending on what is being displayed on the left panel of Modulo

* `delete d/1` +
Deletes the deadline of index 1 from the event viewed on the right panel of Modulo

* `delete d/all` +
Deletes all the deadlines from the event viewed on the right panel of Modulo


=== Importing a Calendar: `import`

Imports an .ics file to be parsed. +
Imports all .ics files within the import directory (if no directory is specified, the default directory will be searched).
If filename is specified, only the selected one will be imported. +
Files will be moved to archive once imported. +

Format: `import [d/DIRECTORY] [f/FILENAME]`
